# BitcoMine Token (BME)
contract is a combination of multi rewarding mechanisms, and an auto liquidity generation added function. 11% of fees from each successful transaction will be redistributed to the holders in BTC each 24 hours, 1% of fees from each successful transaction will be redistributed to the holders in BME each 12 hours. While the third reward model is the BitcoCycle which will be launched after 60 days from launching on pancakewap. BME initial liquidity is locked for one year through the DxSale protocol to raise trust in the community.

## BitcoMine new rewarding model 
Starting from '25/09/2021 at 23:59:59' BitcoMine will stop the use of its old rewarding model '11%' of fees from each successful transaction will be redistributed to the holders in BTC each 24 hours, '1%' of fees from each successful transaction will be redistributed to the holders in BME each 12 hours. 'This means' that you will be no longer have to pay fees ('13%' Buy/'18%' Sell). You can use minimist slippage on Pancakeswap '(0.1% Buy and Sell)'.

'It should be noted that all BME transactions between wallets will remain 18%'. e.g. you hold 100 BME tokens in 'X' wallet and you will transfer your tokens to 'Y' wallet you will pay '18%'.

'30%' of BME total supply will be distributed to the holders on Pancakeswap.

Starting from '01/10/2021 00:00:01' BME will adopt new rewarding system based on net profit of BME token. 'This means' '12%' of net profit will be distributed to BME Pancake holders as (11% BTC , 1% BME). All calculations will be on daily basis, profits will be updated on weekly basis and distribution will be on monthly basis. 'It should be noted that all holders must register their wallets manually on BitcoDash to start benefiting from BME new rewarding model'.
